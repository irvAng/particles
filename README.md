# Particles
## A particle system simulation.

Particles is a project made in javaScript using p5js, a library designed for art creation. The project is based on Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code. The idea of the project is to simulate the attraction of particles to an attractor, simulating forces of gravity, acceleration, velocity, and other parameters. This attractor is in turn a wandering attractor, which is as well a type of simulation found The nature of Code.
